## Tree
### Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree. Here is an example:

### In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal.

### Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
